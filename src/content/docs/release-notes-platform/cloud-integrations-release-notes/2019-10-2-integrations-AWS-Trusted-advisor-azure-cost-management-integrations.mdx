<h3>New</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>AWS Trusted Advisor integration</strong>
  <ul>
	<li>New Relic now offers an integration with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AWS Trusted Advisor</a>. AWS establishes <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">limits for each service</a> in each account and region. Some examples are: <em>number of Auto Scaling groups</em>, <em>number of EBS active volumes</em>, and <em>number of EC2 elastic IP addresses</em>. AWS recommends watching these limits, and even allows you to enable automated actions and custom notifications. That data is now also available in New Relic.</li>
	<li>For more information on how to enable the integration, check out the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-trusted-advisor-integration">integration documentation</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Azure Cost Management integration</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>New Relic now offers a cloud integration with the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cost-management/">Azure Cost Management</a> service. It provides the accumulated costs in the billing period, grouped by cloud service, resource group, region and (if configured) custom tags.</li>

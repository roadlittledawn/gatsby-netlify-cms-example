# Prototype for NR Docs
Prototype for NR docs site. Uses Gatsby to transform markdown files to generate static site. Deploys to Netlify for now.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:roadlittledawn/gatsby-netlify-cms-example.git
cd gatsby-netlify-cms-example
npm install
npm start
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

# TODO

## Must Do's
Things we need to support out of the box for MVP:
* Add XML sitemap
* Use frontmatter to set `<meta>` and other related tags (swiftype, SEO, hreflang links)
* Change index.mdx template to use its own template

## Do later
Things we can do later as future enhancement / not in scope for MVP:
* Add / figure out how translation (smartling)
* Add field validation for certain graphql/frontmatter types
  * `path`: ensure unique. decide if user should supply or automatically generated based on directory? use default gatsby pattern (slugified directory and filename path) if not specified
* Eventually figure out how to add dynamic content to directory index pages like links to related docs, etc)

# Notes to self (or whomever is reading)
* I'm inclined to not make API doc its own content type, because many fields are HTML fields and it won't really work with frontmatter syntax.
* Site nav: Dynamically navigate through all directories OR links off to landing pages?
* Decision: How much of frontmatter is optional / required? What are defaults if any?
* JSON: To meet our needs to output different content types to JSON, we really need to be able to add feed names in order to create multiple feeds with different structures. I forked plugin repo, made those changes, and [submitted PR](https://github.com/dominicfallows/gatsby-plugin-json-output/pull/10).
